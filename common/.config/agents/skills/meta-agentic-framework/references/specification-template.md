# specification: <project or phase name>

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the required behavior for `<scope>`. It is
self-contained and can be handed to a coding agent in a fresh session.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Problem statement and scope

Describe the target problem, intended users, and explicit non-goals.

### 2.2 Design decisions and rationale

Capture key decisions and why alternatives were rejected.

### 2.3 System structure

List modules, boundaries, and interactions that matter for correctness.

### 2.4 External interfaces

Define API shapes, protocol contracts, and compatibility constraints.

### 2.5 Data model

Define entities, invariants, and migration expectations if applicable.

### 2.6 Error handling

Define required error semantics, retries, and user-visible failure behavior.

### 2.7 Testing strategy

Describe how behavior is validated at unit, integration, and end-to-end
levels. Do not include test implementation details in requirement items.

### 2.8 Operational concerns

Include relevant performance, security, observability, deployment, and
rollback requirements.
