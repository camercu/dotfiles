Firefox 57+ is supported.","fullDescription":"Overview\n\nCookie Quick Manager: A complete manager for cookies accumulated during browsing.\nIt allows you to view, edit, create, delete, backup, restore cookies and search them by domain names. Contextual Identities such as Private Browsing, First-Party Isolation, and SameSite flag are also supported.\nIn addition, the LocalStorage of the page viewed can be deleted (see below).\n\nCookie Quick Manager is designed for developers, testers or people\nconcerned about their privacy on the Internet.\n\nThis WebExtension is compatible with Firefox 57 and is inspired by addons like Cookies Manager+ and Advanced Cookie Manager whose development has been discontinued due to the withdrawal of the support for \"Legacy\" extensions.\n\nNovember 2018: Cookie Quick Manager is now available on Android!\n\nFeatures\n\n    User friendly: Clear and structured user interface. Each parameter and functionality is described when the mouse is over the element.\n    Windowed and tab mode: Choose the opening in a tab to get a wider view.\n    Transparency and security: The source code is free (under GPLv3) and published on a public platform, the only way to allow reviews and external contributions.\n    Search: A user can search for cookies of a domain and subdomains which depend on it.\n    Edit/Create: All the attributes of a cookie can be modified: domain, path, name, value, expiration date, as well as secure and httponly flags.\n    Delete: Remove the cookies of the current website in two clicks.\n    Export: The export and import of one or many cookies from one or many domains at a time in JSON or Netscape format is just as easy.\n    First-Party Isolation: Supported with some limitations (due to API bugs) on Firefox 59, 60, and 61, and without limitations on Firefox 62 (scheduled on September 2018).\n    Contexts: Contexts (also called Multi-Account Containers, or Contextual Identities) are supported. A user can search and display cookies inside a container, or copy cookies from a container to another, or save a cookie in a specific context.\n    SameSite: The SameSite flag is supported. This is a partial protection against the risks associated with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) attacks, implemented since Firefox 63.\n    Cookie protection: Delete cookies except protected ones, with two clicks at anytime from the website you are viewing. An option can also prevent cookies from being deleted by the sites themselves.\n    Protection of session cookies: Session cookies can be protected in two clicks to prevent accidental logout from websites after cleaning normal cookies.\n    Cleaning and privacy: Can automatically delete all cookies at startup.\n    LocalStorage: Keys/values of the page viewed can be deleted.\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nThis addon does not store or leak any personal information.\n\nIt requires the following permissions to operate:\n\n    Host permission for all urls: This allows you to edit the cookies and to delete the Localstorage of any site visited.\n    Cookies: Allows access to the browser's cookie store.\n    ActiveTab: Allows access to the currently consulted url, and its favicon if it exists.\n    Storage: Allows the storage of the following user settings:\n    - size of the windowed mode,\n    - protected cookies (only the name of the domains),\n    - the template used to import/export the cookies,\n    - the skin.\n    Browsing data: Enables extensions to clear the data that is accumulated while the user is browsing (LocalStorage here).\n    Contextual Identities: Allows the addon to list the containers.\n    Privacy: Access and modify various privacy-related browser settings (the FirstPartyIsolation flag here).\n    ClipboardWrite (optional): Allows the export of cookies to the clipboard from Firefox 63.\n\n\n\nAbout cookie protection\n\nThe protection of cookies is limited to the current addon actions, to the deletions that can be made by the sites themselves, or to the deletions made in the browser's \"Cookies and Site Data\" options.\nThis means that if you choose the browser option to delete all cookies when it closes, the addon will be unable to restore them (the method used by the browser does not send the necessary signal to notify the addon). However, a similar option is reimplemented in the addon itself in order to keep only the protected cookies when restarting the browser.\n\n\nWhat is \"Delete Current Site Local Storage\" on the popup menu?\n\nThis item allows a user to delete LocalStorage keys from the viewed page.\n\nThe LocalStorage is a quite new feature of HTML5 that allows developers to create data in your browser using JavaScript. Cookies are just one type of storage among others.\nYou will also find the term \"SessionStorage\", a LocalStorage where data is stored temporarily (deleted on browser restart), but the important thing is that LocalStorage is persistent, and cleared only at the discretion of the visited websites.\nYou may erase all of the LocalStorage store by following the procedure described in the documentation of Firefox, and by selecting \"Offline Website Data\".\n\nFrom the point of view of privacy and security:\n\nThis kind of persistant data (even after clearing cache), was invented to store small data allowing the operation of online applications, but also offers new and better accurate ways of tracking thanks to the memorization of private or identifying data.\n\n\nSupport & source code\n\nThe extension is still in development with the launch of Firefox Quantum; questions, bug reports and feature requests are open on the GitHub repository.\n\n\nLicense\n\nGPLv3.","weeklyDownloads":4667,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ysard","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13597965/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211222.png?modified=1622132873","width":293,"height":170,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211222.jpg?modified=1622132873","thumbnailWidth":293,"thumbnailHeight":170,"caption":"Contextual menu on Firefox.

For a simpler tool and less advanced configuration options, please use FoxyProxy Basic.","fullDescription":"Broken after updating to Firefox 71?\nPlease remove FoxyProxy, restart Firefox, and re-install. There is some upgrade bug with Firefox 71.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers based on URL patterns. Put simply, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox's Connection Settings dialog. Proxy server switching occurs based on the loading URL and the switching rules you define.\n\n* Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n* Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n* (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.

The \"Download history\" permission is required only because Firefox does not allow add-ons to specify just \"download files\" without \"download history\". It's all or nothing. Internally, nothing is done with your download history. This is open source software and you can view the code yourself by unzipping the downloaded then using a text viewer, or by visiting https://github.com/foxyproxy/firefox-extension\n\n\"Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data\": this is used by the big eraser button since version 6.3. You can delete cookies, cache, etc with one-click. A future version will allow you to clear the data automatically when switching proxies, just like the old FoxyProxy (pre-Firefox Quantum / Firefox 57).\n\nANDROID\nAs of 2020, FoxyProxy works on Firefox for Android!\n\n    Switch proxies with URL pattern matching\n    Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n    (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.
